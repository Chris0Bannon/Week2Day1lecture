HEYYY

whats a getter setter?  it goes and gets something from where you point,
or its sets something.

.data() is a getter setter that we use for magic behind the scene.

dain said we are going to turn some shit into objects eventually
wow i hope so.  objects are the future.

weve got attributts
class id type etc
data - is a fun one
data - taco = "yes"
there is data here, its type is taco, its value is "yes"

.data can set data dynamically on elements
